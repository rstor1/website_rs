		<p class="aboutText">My name is Ryan Storm and I recently finished my studies in computer science at Concordia University in Montréal, Québec.<br><br>

		This site is being built as way to test things that interest me and to get a handle on web development. Prior to attending school, I had zero experience in any kind of coding and now that I am finished, I look forward to becoming more proficient in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP, AJAX, Java and perhaps Python along the way.<br><br> 

		What I want to do here is write algorithms to create graphics that reflect this liking for computation while also using my past experience in design. For instance, those lines on the home page are straight lines positioned on a Cartesian coordinate system in such a way that produces parabolic curves. These lines are drawn using a JavaScript function I wrote and not merely an image in between HTML tags. The goal is to build this site in an interactive kind of way while exploring such geometry through coding. I feel the possibilities are endless in what these processors can do; much like a blank canvas is to a painter.<br><br>

		Some other things about me: Throughout life, I have had a thing about being interested in a multitude of things. My first job was a farm hand in Indiana and from there I became a carpenter, an aircraft cabinet finisher, industrial designer, special effects makeup technician <a class="imdbLink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0832616/">(IMDb)</a> and now becoming a web/software developer. Other areas of interest are the data sciences/analysis, well just about any of the sciences really and music. One word of caution while navigating this site, beware the Black Hole!! You may have no access back to the site once inside it. So thanks for stopping by, now back to coding:)<br><br></p>
